To create this template, I used HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, SLICK-SLIDER, ANIMATE-CSS, GULP, SCSS.

How I did it - I found a video of how a professional markup a website, downloaded the same template, and started to markup it by myself.

When I didn’t know how to make this or that block, I turned to Google for help, if I didn’t find the necessary information, I watched how a person does it in a video.
